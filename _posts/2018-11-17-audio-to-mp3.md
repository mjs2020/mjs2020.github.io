Over the years I had accumulated a number of audio recordings done with Audacity with a mix of formats and quality. I had these stored on a Synology NAS in a deeply nested structure and I wanted to standardise the format to 320kbps mp3 files so I wrote the following script to do so.

The script does the following:

* Traverses a directory tree recursively (using python's `os.walk`)
* Guesses the file type using the `filetype` package (some files had a format that did not match the extension)
* If file is OGG, Flac or Wav it triggers ffmpeg to convert it to 320k mp3.
* On success it removes the old file

To set it up, create a file `flac_to_mp3.py` with contents:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import os
import sys
import filetype

print('FLAC to MP3 Script')

if len(sys.argv) > 1:
    folder = sys.argv[1]
    print('Will scan folder ' + folder)
    for dirpath, dnames, fnames in os.walk(folder):
        for f in fnames:
            sys.stdout.write('.')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            file_path = os.path.join(dirpath, f)
            file_kind = filetype.guess(file_path)
            if file_kind is None:
                continue
            elif file_kind.mime == "audio/x-flac" \
                    or file_kind.mime == "audio/x-wav" \
                    or file_kind.mime == "audio/ogg":
                print('\nConverting: ' + file_kind.mime + ' - ' + file_path)
                destination_file = os.path.splitext(file_path)[0] + '.mp3'
                os.system("ffmpeg -i \"{0}\" -ab 320k -map_metadata 0 -y -id3v2_version 3 \"{1}\"" \
                    .format(file_path, destination_file))
                os.remove(file_path)
else:
    print('Usage: ./flac_to_mp3.py /path/to/folder')

```

if you are on Linux or OSX give it execution permission: 

`chmod +x flac_to_mp3.py`

And run it:

`./flac_to_mp3.py /absolute/path/to/your/audio/directory`
